How it works

The plugin is used for catching user's location via his IP address. Features include the possibility to manually edit the default location with a mouse click. 

How to list a plugin

Html document should include:
 - <div> tag with a unique id, where you bind a plugin 
 - <a> tag with the name of the default location
 - <span> tag with the edit logo
